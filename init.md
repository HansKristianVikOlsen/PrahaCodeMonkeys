We want to create a svelte application where users can upload create and delete its own photos. Users should be able to look at other users photos. The photos should be listed in as an infinite list/scroling. 
If you tap on a photo a modal should be opened up where the picture is bigger and options are shown. If the user owns the photo he/she can do crud as said before but also comment. If user do not own the photo he/she can only comment.
