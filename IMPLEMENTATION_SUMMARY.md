# Implementation Summary: GitHub Secrets for .env File

## Overview

This implementation adds support for automatically generating a `.env` file from GitHub secrets during the CI/CD pipeline. The `.env` file is then deployed with the application to Azure Web App.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Existing Build Issue
**File**: `src/lib/server/db.ts`
- Removed duplicate import of `uploadPhoto` (was imported twice on lines 3 and 10)
- This was preventing the build from succeeding

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/main_ckcopilotapp.yml`

Added a new step in the build job that creates a `.env` file from GitHub secrets:

```yaml
- name: Create .env file from GitHub secrets
  run: |
    cat > .env << EOF
    # Azure Blob Storage Configuration
    # This file is created from GitHub secrets during CI/CD
    
    # Photo Storage Container URL with SAS token
    AZURE_PHOTO_STORAGE_URL=${{ secrets.AZURE_PHOTO_STORAGE_URL }}
    
    # Comment Storage Container URL with SAS token
    AZURE_COMMENT_STORAGE_URL=${{ secrets.AZURE_COMMENT_STORAGE_URL }}
    
    # Azure Storage Account Details
    AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=${{ secrets.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT }}
    AZURE_PHOTO_CONTAINER=${{ secrets.AZURE_PHOTO_CONTAINER }}
    AZURE_COMMENT_CONTAINER=${{ secrets.AZURE_COMMENT_CONTAINER }}
    EOF
```

This step:
- Runs before the build step
- Creates a `.env` file in the project root
- Populates it with values from GitHub secrets
- The `.env` file is then used during the build process
- The `.env` file is included in the deployment artifact (via `path: .`)

### 3. Added Documentation
**New File**: `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md`

Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Overview of the feature
- Required GitHub secrets and their purpose
- Step-by-step instructions for configuring secrets
- How to obtain Azure Storage URLs and SAS tokens
- How the workflow uses the secrets
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting guide
- References to related documentation

### 4. Updated README
**File**: `README.md`

Added a new section under "Production Considerations" that references the GitHub secrets documentation:
- Links to `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md`
- Brief description of the feature

## How It Works

### Build Process
1. GitHub Actions workflow is triggered (on push to main or manual dispatch)
2. Repository is checked out
3. Node.js is set up
4. **New Step**: `.env` file is created from GitHub secrets
5. Dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
6. Application is built (`npm run build`)
7. Build artifact (including `.env`) is uploaded

### Deployment Process
1. Build artifact is downloaded
2. Azure login is performed
3. Application is deployed to Azure Web App with the `.env` file

### Runtime
- The deployed application reads environment variables from the `.env` file
- SvelteKit's `$env/static/private` module provides access to these variables
- The variables are used to connect to Azure Blob Storage

## Required GitHub Secrets

Repository administrators must configure these secrets in GitHub:

1. `AZURE_PHOTO_STORAGE_URL` - Azure Blob Storage URL for photo container with SAS token
2. `AZURE_COMMENT_STORAGE_URL` - Azure Blob Storage URL for comment container with SAS token
3. `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` - Azure Storage account name
4. `AZURE_PHOTO_CONTAINER` - Name of the photo container
5. `AZURE_COMMENT_CONTAINER` - Name of the comment container

See `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions on how to set these up.

## Testing

The implementation was tested by:
1. Creating a test `.env` file with dummy values
2. Running `npm run build` successfully
3. Verifying the build output includes all required files
4. Confirming the `.env` file is in the root directory (where it will be uploaded)
5. Verifying `.gitignore` properly excludes `.env` files from version control

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ The built app has the `.env` file  
✅ The `.env` file is deployed with the app  
✅ The `.env` file uses GitHub secrets  

## Next Steps for Repository Administrator

1. Navigate to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add each of the five required secrets listed above
3. Push code to the main branch or manually trigger the workflow
4. Verify the deployment succeeds and the app can access Azure Storage

## Security Considerations

- The `.env` file is never committed to version control (excluded via `.gitignore`)
- Secrets are only accessible during the GitHub Actions workflow execution
- SAS tokens should be rotated regularly
- SAS tokens should have minimal required permissions and appropriate expiration dates
- The `.env` file in the deployed app contains sensitive credentials and should be protected by Azure Web App security settings

## Files Modified or Created

### Modified
- `src/lib/server/db.ts` - Fixed duplicate import
- `.github/workflows/main_ckcopilotapp.yml` - Added .env creation step
- `README.md` - Added reference to secrets documentation

### Created
- `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive secrets setup guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Not Modified (Already Correct)
- `.gitignore` - Already excludes `.env` files
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables (unchanged)
- `package.json` - Build scripts (unchanged)
